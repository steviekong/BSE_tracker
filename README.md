Hosted at http://159.89.166.26/

## Getting started

This development setup has only been tested on OSX 11.2.3

### Prerequisites

- node v14.\*
- npm v6.14.\*
- python 3.9 \*
- pip pip 21.0.1 \*
- Redis server 6.2.1

### Directory structure

`backend` directory contains the django backend application.

`frontend` directory contains the vue frontend application.

### Setup for Local deployment

1. Clone this repository

2. cd into frontend directory
   `cd BSE_tracker/frontend`

3. Install npm packages
   `npm install`

4. Build static files
   `npm run build`

5. cd to backend directory
   `cd ../backend`

6. Create virtual env
   `python3 -m venv env`

7. Activate virtual env
   `source env/bin/activate`

8. Install pip packages
   `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

9. Add cron tab
   `python3 manage.py crontab add`

You should see something like this as the output

`adding cronjob: (dd0a834c2648e926c551c5c97caa4ff4) -> ('00 18 * * *', 'backend.cron.get_bahv_add_to_redis')`

This cronjob will run at 18:00 IST daily assuming system time is set to accurate IST time.

10. Make sure you have redis server running

11. Start django server
    `python3 manage.py runserver`

If the server starts successfully you should see the following

```
Django version 3.2, using settings 'backend.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

The app should be running on http://localhost:8000 .

### Populating data

You might notice that there is no data when you search a for a company. That is because the cron job only populates the data at 18:00 daily.

If you want to populate the data quickly you can change the cron job to run every minute by doing the following

1. Edit `settings.py` located at `backend/backend/settings.py`.

2. Change line 138 to

```python
CRONJOBS = [
    ('* * * * *', 'backend.cron.get_bahv_add_to_redis')
]
```

3. Remove the existing crontab
   `python3 manage.py crontab remove`

4. Add the updated crontab
   `python3 manage.py crontab add`

5. Wait about a minute and redis should have populated all the required data.
